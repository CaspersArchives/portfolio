	<h2> Editing </h2>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">Davinci Resolve</H3>
			<p> My Primary Editing software. I started using Davinci around 2021, this is also my primary VFX program, although I dont typically do VFX.  </p>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">Premiere</H3>
			<p> A software I rarely use nowadays. Though to say the least, I am well verse in the software in terms of the basics. </p>
<br>
	<h2> Audio Production </h2>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">FL Studio</H3>
			<p> The love of my life you can say. This is my oldest used software in my arsenal of the bunch, since 2017 or earlier. All my recodings and SFX for film or music are made here. I primarily use FL for its intended purpose, Music Production, but I use it for other audio related things because of the flexibility. </p>
<br>
	<h2> 3D </h2>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">Blender</H3>
			<p> Blender is my main 3D software, since 2020. However, This is one of those beginner to Intermediate level skills I have. I dont really do modeling here, only sometimes, mostly used for cover arts or background design  </p>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">3DS Max</H3>
			<p> I'm still a beginner in this software. But with that in mind, I'm learning modeling within it, though the very basics. </p>
<br>
	<h2> Graphics </h2>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">Ilustrator</H3>
			<p> The software I'll probably go to with when it comes to graphic design. I primarily use this software for small projects such as: Symbols, Logos or Layouting and such. I'm around intermediate level within this software, but if im lost or want to do a bigger project, I'll find some tips.  </p>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">Photoshop</H3>
			<p> Is my secondary graphic design software, if there is something I can't do in ilustrator, in terms of a specific photo manipulation I'll edit or do it here instead. I also use it's intended purpose of photo editing.  </p>
<br>
	<h2> Others </h2>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">HTML</H3>
			<p> I've been interested in coding for some time now, in forms of Game and App Developing. Though Web dev rarely, if not never came to mind, I'll still learn, as I have ideas I can do in the future. </p>
