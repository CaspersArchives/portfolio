			<h4>My name is Reginald 'Reg' Tolentino, or you can call me by my alias, <u>Casper</u>. I'm an artist from the Philippines. I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia in 2003, until moving to the Philippines in 2017. Currently, I'm studying at the College of Saint Benilde. From as early as seven, my interest in Films and Music began. This interest evolved into a passion with some of those interests coming to fruition in 2017, with my first attempt at music production and filmmaking later in 2024. As a young and quiet artist, I'm still trying to hone my craft and figure out who's me in my works. In some aspects I have, it may not be as in depth as I wanted it, but I have. But as of now, I'm still experimenting, finding inspiration wherever, playing around with sounds, styles, and techniques, doing whatever I please, and what others want from me, and maybe I might find it.
