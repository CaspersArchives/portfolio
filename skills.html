	<h2> Editing </h2>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">Davinci Resolve</H3>
			<p> My Primary Editing software. I started using Davinci around 2021, this is also my primary VFX program, although I don't typically do VFX. But anyways, every and any video editing job I have will be started with Davinci.  </p>
&nbsp;
		<H3 style="color: #545454; ">Premiere</H3>
			<p> A software I rarely use nowadays. Even if I've just started using in in 2024 for school works. Personally, it just don't hit the same as my primary. Though to say the least, I am well verse in the software in terms of the basics. </p>
<br>
	<h2> Audio Production </h2>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">FL Studio</H3>
			<p> The love of my life you can say. This is my oldest used software in my arsenal of the bunch, since 2017 or earlier. All my recodings and SFX for film or music are made here. I primarily use FL for its intended purpose, Music Production, but I use it for other audio related things because of the flexibility. </p>
<br>
	<h2> 3D </h2>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">Blender</H3>
			<p> Blender is my main 3D software, since 2020. However, This is one of those beginner to Intermediate level skills I have. I don't really do modeling here, only sometimes, mostly used for cover arts or background design  </p>
&nbsp;
		<H3 style="color: #545454;">3DS Max</H3>
			<p> I'm still a beginner with this software, starting late 2024. So I'm still learning the <b>very</b> basics. As to what I'm learning on it, Modeling. </p>
<br>
	<h2> Graphics </h2>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">Illustrator</H3>
			<p> The software I'll probably go to with when it comes to graphic design, since mid to late 2023. Ever since starting out, it's been the main graphic software I use for school and my small projects such as: Symbols, Logos or Layouting and more. I'm around intermediate level within this software, but if I'm lost or want to do a bigger projects out of my comfort zone? I'll find some tips.  </p>
&nbsp;
		<H3 style="color: #545454;">Photoshop</H3>
			<p> Is my secondary graphic design software, if there is something I can't do in illustrator, in terms of a specific photo manipulation I'll edit or do it here instead. I also use it's intended purpose of photo editing.  </p>
<br>
	<h2> Others </h2>

		<H3 style="color: #545454;">HTML</H3>
			<p> I've been interested in coding for some time now, in forms of Game and App Developing. Though Web dev rarely, if not never came to mind, I'll still learn, as I have ideas I can do in the future. </p>
